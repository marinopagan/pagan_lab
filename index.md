### Welcome to the Pagan Lab at the University of Edinburgh

Our interactions with the world are highly flexible. For example, our response to the sound of our phone ringing will be very different if we are watching a play at the theater, or if we are anxiously waiting for an important call. More generally, our thoughts and actions depend heavily on "context", which includes our goals, past experience, and future expectations. How does our brain integrate such contextual information with the constant stream of sensory stimuli to flexibly guide our decisions?

In our laboratory, we address this question using a combination of computational, behavioral, electrophysiological, and optogenetic techniques. By investigating the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility and decision-making, we aim to understand how these fundamental cognitive processes are disrupted in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Our goal is to address three fundamental questions:

### What neural mechanisms underlie our ability to flexibly form decisions?

To study the neural basis of flexible decision-making, we train rats to solve sophisticated tasks with rapidly changing rules. In these tasks, rats learn to use contextual information to flexibly form decisions about sensory stimuli. We then study neural responses during this behavior, and we build computational models to understand the underlying mechanisms.

### How do neural computations underlying cognitive behavior vary across individuals?

We found that [individual rats use different neural mechanisms to solve flexible decision-making](https://github.com/Humphries-Lab/Bayesian_Strategy_Analysis_Python). These findings highlight the need for methods that measure and characterize these neural circuits at the level of individual animals. To achieve this goal, we leverage a system for automated, high-throughput behavioral training, integrated with wireless electrophysiology and optogenetics. To understand why circuits differ after subjects learn the task, we aim to explore the behavioral and neural correlates of individual learning trajectories.

### How do genetic mutations impact neural circuits underlying flexible decision-making?

Deficits in cognitive flexibility and decision-making are a profoundly debilitating feature in many neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite significant recent progress in identifying the genetic causes of these disorders, the mechanisms linking genetic mutations to cognitive deficits are still largely unknown. To address this problem, we study how flexible decision-making is altered in rat models of neurodevelopmental disorders. Using electrophysiology, optogenetics and computational analyses, we study how cellular and circuit alterations induced by genetic mutations affect cognitive computations at the system level.

#### Funding and Support


Our laboratory is part of the [Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain (SIDB)](https://sidb.org.uk/) and the [Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences (CDBS)](https://discovery-brain-sciences.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh. We fully embrace the spirit of collaboration of SIDB and CDBS and collaborate with many researchers within the Institutes.

We are currently supported by generous funding by the [Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative](https://www.sfari.org/) and SIDB.
