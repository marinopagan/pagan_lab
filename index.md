### Welcome to the Pagan Lab at the University of Edinburgh

Our interactions with the world are highly flexible. Our response to the sensation of our phone ringing is very different in the context of having just heard ‘the play is beginning; please silence all phones’ versus a context in which we have just been told ‘your child’s school is about to call with urgent information’. In our laboratory, we use a combination of experimental and computational approaches to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying our remarkable ability to flexibly select the relevant information to guide our decisions.

In particular, we aim to address three fundamental questions:

### What neural computations underlie cognitive processes, such as our ability to flexibly form decisions?
Investigating how, when, and what subjects learn during decision-making tasks requires tracking their choice strategies on a trial-by-trial basis. In our new paper, we present a simple but effective probabilistic approach to tracking choice strategies at trial resolution. We show it identifies both successful learning and the exploratory strategies used in decision tasks performed by humans, non-human primates, rats, and synthetic agents.

How does our brain flexibly select 


For example, if we hear our name called, and our goal is to discern where the caller is, we might focus on the sound’s location; but if we first want to identify the caller, we might focus instead on the sound’s pitch and timbre.

If my name is called out, and my goal is to turn towards the caller, the sound’s location will guide my actions. But if my goal is to respond based on the caller’s identity, the sound’s frequencies will drive my actions.

Our response to the sensation of our phone ringing will be very different in the context of having just heard ‘the play is beginning; please silence all phones’ versus a context in which we have just been told ‘your child’s school is about to call with urgent information’.
