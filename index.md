### Welcome to the Pagan Lab at the University of Edinburgh

Our interactions with the world are highly flexible. If we hear our phone ringing, our response will be very different if we are at the theater watching a play, or if we are at home waiting for an important call. More generally, our thoughts and actions depend heavily on the current "context", which includes our goals, past experience, and future expectations. How does our brain integrate such contextual information with the constant stream of sensory stimuli to flexibly guide our decisions?

In our laboratory, we address this question using a combination of computational, behavioral, electrophysiological, and optogenetic techniques. By investigating the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility and decision-making, we aim to understand how these fundamental cognitive processes are disrupted in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Our goal is to address three fundamental questions:

# What neural mechanisms underlie our ability to flexibly form decisions?

To study the neural basis of flexible decision-making, we train rats to solve sophisticated tasks with rapidly changing rules. In these tasks, rats learn to use contextual information to flexibly form decisions about sensory stimuli. We then study neural responses during this behavior, and we build computational models to understand the underlying mechanisms.

## How do neural computations underlying cognitive behavior vary across individuals?

[Our recent work show that individual rats use different neural mechanisms to perform flexible decision-making](https://github.com/Humphries-Lab/Bayesian_Strategy_Analysis_Python). These findings suggest that traditional approaches involving averaging data across subjects might obscure important biological substrates of cognition, and highlight the need for methods that measure and characterize these neural circuits at the level of individual animals. To achieve this goal, we leverage a system for automated, high-throughput behavioral training, integrated with wireless electrophysiology and optogenetics.

### How do genetic mutations impact neural circuits underlying flexible decision-making?

Deficits in cognitive flexibility and decision-making are a profoundly debilitating feature in many neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent studies have made significant progress in identifying the genetic causes of these disorders, but the mechanisms linking genetic mutations to cognitive deficits are still largely unknown. To address this problem, we study how flexible decision-making is altered in rat models of neurodevelopmental disorders.

How does our brain flexibly select 


For example, if we hear our name called, and our goal is to discern where the caller is, we might focus on the sound’s location; but if we first want to identify the caller, we might focus instead on the sound’s pitch and timbre.

If my name is called out, and my goal is to turn towards the caller, the sound’s location will guide my actions. But if my goal is to respond based on the caller’s identity, the sound’s frequencies will drive my actions.

Our response to the sensation of our phone ringing will be very different in the context of having just heard ‘the play is beginning; please silence all phones’ versus a context in which we have just been told ‘your child’s school is about to call with urgent information’.

## Our research focuses on the neural mechanisms underlying flexible decision-making.



## We aim to address three fundamental questions:



train rats and mice to perform tasks that require cognitive components that we’re interested in studying. For example, we train them to remember a stimulus for a few seconds, and to then make a behavior based on their memory of the stimulus. We can then study neural responses during this behavior, and observe the neural correlates of short-term memory. To help us understand the mechanisms behind our findings, we build computational models of networks of spiking neurons, with which we explore the circuit architectures and mechanistic hypotheses that could explain the experimental results. The models both give us greater insight into potential mechanisms, and help us decide what are the best next experiments to test and distinguish between hypotheses.
